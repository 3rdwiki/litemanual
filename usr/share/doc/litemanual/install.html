            <p>To install Linux Lite you will need to download the ISO file, then create either 
            a bootable CD/DVD or USB stick from the ISO.  To create a bootable CD/DVD, you need
            to burn the ISO as an "image" to the CD/DVD.  Below are listed three free Windows 
            programs that will enable you to do that.  If burning to a USB stick, we have also 
            listed a free program that we recommend for doing that in Windows; or a reliable 
            method to create a bootable USB when using a Linux system, or OSX.</p>
            <p>Once you have your bootable media created, you may need to access your computer's
            BIOS settings to set the boot order for booting CD/DVD/USB's first (before the hard
            drive).  Typically there will be one or two special keys that can be pressed during 
            initial power-up of the computer (before an operating system starts booting) that will
            allow you access to either the BIOS Settings/Startup Menu or a separate Boot Menu.  
            Specific keys vary from one manufacturer to the next, so refer to your user manual if 
            you are not sure how to access the settings.</p>

          <p>Place a blank DVD in your DVD drive, open up the program, select 
		  the iso file that you want to burn. Choose the lowest burn speed, this

          <p>If you are planning to have Linux Lite as the sole operating system on your computer, there
          is nothing special you need to do in preparation for the installation - even if another operating
          system is currently occupying the hard drive.  Simply boot up your live installation disk, give 
          Linux Lite a test run if you'd like, then start the installation by double-clicking the "Install"
          icon on the desktop.  When you get to the "Installation Type" screen, tell the installer to use the 
          whole disk and it will go ahead and erase anything that is already there, create the partitions 
          needed, format them and install the system automatically.</p>
          <p>If you currently have <b><u>one</u> physical hard drive</b> and want to dual-boot Windows and Linux Lite, 
          then you should do a few things to prepare for the installation to insure the best results.</p>

            Start your computer, and go into your system Bios and check that the 
		  boot order is set so that DVD and USB devices are set to boot first. 
		  This varies from bios to bios. Refer to your motherboard documentation 
		  for more information.<br />
            Once you are happy with your bios set up, insert the DVD disc or USB 
		  stick into your computer and reboot your computer. You'll be greeted 
		  with the following screen. Let the timer run down if you want to boot 
		  to the Live session.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/boot1.png" /></p>
          <p> Press any key to see the next screen.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/boot2.png" /></p>
          <p> Make sure <b>Start Linux Lite</b> is highlighted, press the enter 
		  key to boot the Live session. This is also a good way to check that 
		  all of your hardware is supported. If you are having trouble booting 
		  and you get just a black screen, try the second option, <b>Start Linux 
		  Lite in safe graphics mode</b>.</p>
          <p> The other options are:<br />
            <br />
            <b>Run memtest</b> - Test your computer memory for faults.<br />
            <b>Boot the first hard disk</b> - boot the existing operating 
		  system.</p>
          <p> <b>NOTE: If you are having any trouble booting Linux Lite after 
		  installation, please read through 
		  <a href="hardware.html#installissues">this 
		  trouble shooting guide</a>.<br />
            </b><br />
            The computer will go through the boot up process, this may take 
		  anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes depending on your 
		  hardware. The login for the Live user is automatic, there is no need 
		  to login. An explanation of the various Menu's can be found by 
		  clicking <a href="index.html#menus">here</a>.</p>
          <p> Before we proceed, make sure you have an internet connection 
		  first. Click <a href="network.html">here</a> if you need help to get 
		  online before you install Linux Lite.</p>
          <p> Once you've had a look around Linux Lite and are ready to install 
		  the first step is to double click on the <b>Install Linux Lite</b>
            icon on your Desktop. </p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/installicon.png" /> </p>
          <p>The installer will then open on the desktop and display the <b>
		  Welcome</b>
            section of the installer. From here you will select your preferred 
		  language and view release notes for this version of Linux Lite.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/1-language.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>After selecting continue, you are presented with some requirements 
		  for the installation. Ensure that these requirements are met by 
		  viewing a check mark beside them. You may also choose to download any 
		  available updates while installing or install third-party software 
		  during the installation. <b>NOTE: Please verify the legal status of 
		  the use of the third party software in your country/territory.</b></p>
          <p><b>NOTE: </b>Generally we don't recommend ticking <b>Download 
		  updates while installing</b> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">
		  Install the third-party software</span> as this will significantly 
		  slow down the install process. Updating after a fresh install is 
		  recommended and will save you time in the long run. A typical install 
		  on today's hardware will take around 10-15 minutes. If you check these 
		  2 boxes, the install could take over an hour or longer.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/2-prepare.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>Now it is time to choose the method of installing Linux Lite to 
		  your hard disk. You will have several options during this phase of the 
		  installer.</p>
          <p> <b>Install Linux alongside them</b> - otherwise known as a dual 
		  boot. An option to boot from Windows or Linux Lite when your computer 
		  starts.</p>
			<p> <b>Note:</b>  If you DO have Windows on the computer, but are not
		  offered the option to install "Alongside Windows", see the 
			<a href="hardware.html#booting">
		  trouble shooting guide</a>.</p>
			<p> <b>Note:</b>  If you want to encrypt your home folder, <strong>
			do not</strong> select the option '<strong>Encrypt the new Linux 
			installation for security</strong>' instead, please follow these 
			instructions <a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3-selectinstall.jpg" /></p>
          <p><strong>Erase Disk and Install Linux</strong> </p>
          
          <p>Upon selecting Erase Disk and Install Linux you are presented with 
		  a screen displaying how your install will be represented on the hard 
		  disk. This is the most simple option available and will show your hard 
		  disk being completely and solely occupied by Linux Lite. You may 
		  select the disk you wish to install Linux Lite to from the menu 
		  labeled: <b>Select Drive</b>. You may then select <b>Install Now</b>
            when you are ready to begin installing.</p>
          
          <p>(<b>NOTE:</b>  This installation option will automatically install the Linux
          bootloader to the first hard drive on the system.  That is typically how most 
          people install and the Linux boot loader offers the choice of booting any other
          operating systems that are on your computer.  However, if your intent is to 
          keep the Windows boot loader in charge of booting the Windows drive and the Windows 
          drive is the first one, then you need to use the "Something else" installation type.  
          That way you can control the "location for boot loader installation" and set it for 
          the specific drive you choose for Linux Lite.  Again, this is not a necessity when 
          dual-booting.  We point this out only because some people prefer to keep the Windows 
          drive as is.)</p>
          
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3c-replaceinstall.png" /> </p>
          <p><strong>Install Linux alongside Windows (dual booting)</strong></p>
          <p>If you have selected to install Linux Lite alongside an existing 
		  copy of Windows, you will be greeted with a screen representing the 
		  two operating systems on the disk. You may choose the disk to install 
		  Linux Lite to from the top menu labeled: Select Drive. In the main 
		  part of the window you will see your hard disk split into two 
		  sections, one containing your Windows install and one for your 
		  proposed Linux Lite installation. You may drag the empty space between 
		  them to allocate space from one to the other as needed. You may then 
		  select Install Now after you have made the desired changes.<br />
		  If your computer has more than one physical hard drive and your intent 
		  is to install Linux to a separate drive from the Windows drive, see 
		  <a href="hardware.html#install_multi-drive">this section</a>.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3b-installalong.png" /> </p>
          <p><strong>Something Else</strong></p>
          <p><strong>NOTE: FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY</strong></p>
          <p>If the other methods do not fulfill your personal requirements for 
		  installation you may select <b>Something Else</b> and manually 
		  partition your hard disk. There are many options available from this 
		  screen. All of your disks will be visible in a hierarchal tree view in 
		  the main window. From here you can see disk devices, existing 
		  partitions, and unallocated space. If your disk is new or you are 
		  creating a new install in a virtual machine you may need to select <b>
		  New Partition Table</b> from the options below. This will erase the 
		  disk and provide you with a clean slate. <strong>WARNING</strong>: 
		  This will destroy any data on the disk selected! Another option is to 
		  add a partition to the disk by selecting <b>Add</b> from the button 
		  options. This option requires that there exists free space on the disk 
		  with which to create the partition. When adding a partition, you may 
		  select the place on the disk to create the partition, the partition 
		  size, the filesystem type, and the point in the filesystem that this 
		  partition will be mounted. If you need to modify these attributes of a 
		  partition, you may select <b>Change</b>
            from the button options. If there exists partitions that you wish to 
		  be rid of, you can select <b>Delete</b> from the button options to 
		  delete the partition. If you wish to return everything back to its 
		  original state you may use the <b>Revert</b> button. <strong>NOTE</strong><b>: 
		  This will only work if you have not written changes to the disk.</b></p>
          <p>Under the partitioner there is a menu for selecting the location of 
		  the boot loader's installation. You may select a drive's 
		  
		  <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr>, 
		  
		  indicated by the device name e.g. /dev/sda, or you may select a 
		  partition to install the boot loader to. The safest option is to 
		  install the bootloader to the MBR of the first disk as the bootloader 
		  will intelligently add entries for installations of Windows and other 
		  Linux installs.</p>
          <p> <strong>NOTE: If you have any NTFS drives, it is important to give 
		  these a mount point during the install. That way they will be easily 
		  accessible after the installation.</strong>  
		  
		  The mount point is simply "where" in the file system you want that 
		  partition's files to show up. If you want them to show up in your home 
		  directory, then give it a mount point like: /home/username/NTFS_Files. 
		  Substitute your actual username (in all lowercase letters) for 
		  "username". You can name the mount point what ever you want, so you 
		  don't have to use "NTFS_Files" if you have a more descriptive name in 
		  mind. Try not to have any spaces in the mount point name. Use an 
		  underscore (_) character in place of spaces.</p>
		  
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/3a-manualinstall.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>After completing the partitioning phase of the installation, you 
		  are prompted to set up some personal details about the system. The 
		  installer will continue to work in the background while you are 
		  filling out this information. The first step is to select your time 
		  zone. The installer may detect your time zone based on your location 
		  via your ISP's information. If not, you may select your time zone by 
		  either clicking on your region on the supplied map or by typing in 
		  your area in the box below. </p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/4-timezone.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>The next step is to select your keyboard language and layout. You 
		  may select the language that your keyboard corresponds to on the left 
		  and any specialized layout on the right. This is the point where you 
		  may select to enable international keys on your keyboard. Though, 
		  these options may be changed later.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/5-keyboardlayout.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>On the next screen, you are greeted by several forms to fill. These 
		  forms include:</p>
          <p> <b>Your name</b> - your personal name.<br />
            <b>Your computer's name</b> - the name that you wish to use to 
		  identify the computer on your network.<br />
            <b>Pick a username</b> - your user name that is used to login to the 
		  system.<br />
            <b>Choose a password</b> - your password that you wish to use for 
		  your user and sudo password.<br />
            <b>Confirm your password</b> - enter the above password again.</p>
          <p> <b>NOTE: Choose a strong password, a mix of upper and lower case 
		  as well as a mix of numbers and characters. An example of this would 
		  be: <span class="auto-style2">y%9L2x#o</span> would be considered a 
		  strong password. Use a program like <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.keepassx.org/">Keepassx</a> to keep all your 
		  passwords safely stored and NEVER use the same password for different 
		  websites.
		  (Keepassx is available for installation from Menu, System, 
		  Install/Remove Software.  
		  You do not need to download it from their website.)<br />
              <br />
              Never compromise your security for convenience.</b></p>
          <p>There are also options to enable auto-login for your user or have 
		  the computer prompt you for a password everytime you login.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>  If you want to encrypt your home folder,
			<strong>do not</strong> select the option '<strong>Encrypt my home 
			folder</strong>' instead, please follow these instructions 
			<a href="#encrypthome">here</a>.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/6-userinfo.jpg" /> </p>
          <p>If you have a webcam, you may encounter a screen during the install 
		  asking to 'Take a photo' this feature is supported so that when you 
		  first log in, your photo will be displayed as your avatar. If you skip 
		  this step, you can use a .png photo of yourself, rename it to <strong>
		  .face</strong>
            and place it in your <strong>/home/user</strong> folder.</p>
			<p><br />
            After finishing all of these steps you will be greeted with a 
		  slideshow detailing all of the features and software that are included 
		  in this version of Linux Lite. You may allow them to play on their own 
		  or navigate through them using the arrow buttons on the sides of the 
		  window.</p>

		  <img src="img/installer/7-slideshow.jpg"
              alt="slide" /> </p>
          <p>Once the installation is complete you will be prompted to either 
		  restart your computer and begin using your newly installed Linux Lite 
		  system or to continue using the testing environment on the DVD/USB 
		  that you are using. If for some reason your computer hangs on restart, 
		  press F4.</p>
          <p><img alt="" src="img/installer/8-finished.png" /> </p>
          <p>After a reboot you will be greeted by the login screen:</p>

          <p>After you have logged in you will see the desktop. Congratulations!

          <p> After a new installation of Linux Lite, you have the option of 
		  encrypting your home folder for added security. You won't be able to 
		  encrypt your home folder while you are logged in. So we're going to 
		  add a temporary user then when we are finished, we'll delete that 
		  user.</p>
			<p> 1. Click on <strong>Menu, Settings, User Manager</strong>. Click 
			on <strong>New User</strong> and add the user <strong>tempuser</strong> 
			with a password of your choosing. Make sure you tick the <strong>
			sudo</strong> box on the right and click on <b>Apply</b> before closing out User Manager.</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt1.png" /></p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt2.png" /></p>
			<p> 2. Now logout, and login with the user <strong>tempuser</strong>.</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt3.png" /></p>
			<p> 3. Open a terminal and enter the following command to encrypt 
			your home directory, replacing <strong>user</strong> with the name 
			of <strong>your</strong> user account:</p>
			<p> &nbsp;<strong>sudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u user</strong></p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt4.png" /></p>
			<p> 4. When this has finished (time to encrypt may vary) <strong>you 
			must logout of tempuser and login as your user. DO NOT reboot.</strong></p>
			<p> 5. Once logged in as your user, open a terminal and type in:</p>
			<p> <strong>ecryptfs-add-paraphrase</strong></p>
			<p> and enter your login password.</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt5.png" /></p>
			<p> 6. To check that you have successfully created a passphrase, 
			enter the command:</p>
			<p> <strong>ecryptfs-unwrap-paraphrase</strong></p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt6.png" /></p>
			<p> 7. Clean up time. Open a terminal and enter the following 
			commands:</p>
			<p> <strong>sudo userdel tempuser</strong></p>
			<p> <strong>sudo rm -rf /home/tempuser/</strong></p>
			<p> <strong>sudo rm -rf /home/yourusername.3redf/</strong></p>
			<p> When you do the last command, type a dot '.' after your username 
			and press the tab key to complete the directory name.</p>
			<p> <strong>Note: Be extremely careful when doing this last command, 
			you run the risk of deleting your home folder if you do not follow 
			these instructions to the letter.</strong></p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/encrypt/encrypt7.png" /></p>
			<p> Your home folder should now be encrypted. To test, insert a live 
			linux operating system cd/usb and reboot. Once you are in the live 
			desktop, you shouldn't be able to browse your encrypted home folder.</p>

          <p> <font size="4"><a name="language"></a>Setting your Language</font></p>
          <p> Here's how to set a language system wide following an install of 
		  Linux Lite. If you selected a language during the install, skip steps 
		  4, 5 and 7.</p>
          <p> 1. Click on <strong>Menu, Settings, Language Support</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img src="img/installer/lang/lang1.jpg" /></p>
          <p> 2. You will get a dialog box pop up, click on <strong>
		  Install</strong>.</p>
          <p> <img src="img/installer/lang/language-03.png" /></p>
          <p> 3. You will then be prompted for your password, enter it to continue.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-04.png" /></p>
          <p> 4. Now click on the button <strong>Install / Remove Languages</strong>.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-05.png" /></p>
          <p> 5. In this example, we'll install the <strong>Portuguese</strong>
            language. Scroll down, find your language and tick the box next to 
		  it, then click on <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-06.png" /></p>
          <p> Your computer will begin to download all the language files, this 
		  may take a while.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-07.png" /></p>
          <p> 6. Once that is done, scroll to the bottom of the <strong>Language 
		  for menus and windows</strong> box and drag your newly installed 
		  language to the top of the list. Then click on <strong>Apply 
		  System-Wide</strong>, you'll be prompted for your password again.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-08.png" /></p>
          <p> 7. Now click on the <strong>Regional Formats</strong> tab, select the 
		  language you just installed, and click on <strong>Apply System-Wide</strong>.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-09.png" /></p>
          <p> 8. Now logout and login again and you will see that your new language 
		  has been applied.</p>
          <p> 
		  <img class="auto-style3" src="img/installer/lang/language-10.png" /></p>
          <p> Please note that not all programs may not have your language 
		  applied. If this is the case, search for that program in <strong>
              Install/Remove Software</strong> and see if there is a language 
		  pack available for it. Also note that after you have changed your 
		  language, some of the <strong>Menu</strong> items may not be 
		  translated properly. There is little we can do about this, an easy way 
		  to rename <strong>Menu</strong> entries is by going to <strong>Menu, 
		  Settings, Main Menu</strong> and editing the entries there.</p>

          <p> Enabling trim on your SSD will significantly increase its life 
		  span. Here's how to do it on Linux Lite.</p>
			<p> <strong>CAUTION: You MUST edit the following file with great 
			care, a misplaced comma, a gap that shouldn't be there or a missing 
			line will cause you computer to not boot. Take your time and triple 
			check this file for accuracy before saving it.</strong></p>
			<p> Open a terminal and do:</p>
			<p> &nbsp;<strong>sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_bak-notrim</strong></p>
			<p> When that has finished, in the same terminal do:</p>
			<p> <strong>sudo leafpad /etc/fstab</strong></p>
			<p> a file will open that will look similar to this:</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/trim/trim1.png" /></p>
			<p> Look for every line that contains the word <strong>ext4<br />
			</strong>At the start on the next block of information, place the 
			characters <strong>discard,</strong> (don't forget the <strong>comma</strong>)in 
			front like in the picture below:</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/trim/trim2.png" /></p>
			<p> Now save and close the file. At this point you must restart your 
			computer.</p>
			<p> After your computer has rebooted, in a terminal do:</p>
			<p> <strong>wget -O /tmp/test_trim.sh "</strong><a href="http://www.linuxliteos.com/files/test_trim.sh"><strong>http://www.linuxliteos.com/files/test_trim.sh</strong></a>"</p>
			<p> when that file has downloaded, in the same terminal do:</p>
			<p> <strong>chmod +x /tmp/test_trim.sh</strong></p>
			<p> Now we are ready to test if we have TRIM enabled. In the same 
			terminal do:</p>
			<p> <strong>sudo /tmp/test_trim.sh tempfile 50 /dev/sda</strong></p>
			<p> Wait for it to finish, your terminal should look something like 
			this:</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/trim/trim3.png" /></p>
			<p> Hit any key to continue and wait 2 minutes for the test to 
			restart.</p>
			<p> If TRIM has been enabled properly, your terminal should now look 
			like this:</p>
			<p> <img src="img/installer/trim/trim4.png" /></p>
			<p> If for some reason it doesn't, restart this tutorial again 
			carefully following each step to the letter.</p>

          <p> If there are partitions on your drive(s) that you did not set-up 
		  access for during the installation process, you can do that afterwards 
		  by following the instructions in this section. The basic procedure 
		  includes finding out the UUID for your partition, making a mount point 
		  for it in the file system and creating an entry in the /etc/fstab file 
		  for auto-mounting it on every boot-up. A 'mount point' is simply 
		  'where' in the file system you want the partition's files to show up. 
		  Most people like to see them in their Home folder, so that is what the 
		  following examples depict.<br />
          </p>
          <p> <strong>NTFS</strong></p>
          <p> First we need to make a mount point in your home folder. This is

            <br />
            Open a terminal and type: <strong>sudo blkid</strong><br />
            <br />
            followed by your password. This will output the uuid's for all your 
		  hard drives.<br />
            <br />
            Take the uuid for that drive and place it into /etc/fstab, first we

            In the terminal still, type in: <strong>sudo leafpad /etc/fstab</strong><br />
            <br />
            A text file will open up. Lets say the uuid for our new ntfs drive 
		  is - <strong>0463741f-a838-40c8-b40f-3dbb7f988e29</strong>. We would

		  <p> <strong><a name="fat"></a><span class="auto-style1">FAT32</span></strong></p>
		  <p>Follow the same general procedure for auto-mounting FAT32 partitions.</p>
		  <p>First create a mount point in your home folder that will serve as
		  the access point for the files on that partition.  Open the file manager
		  to your home folder, right-click and make a new folder.  This example
		  will name the folder '<strong>fatfiles</strong>'.</p>
		  <p>Open a terminal and enter this command:  <b>sudo blkid</b>.  Enter
		  your password when asked.</p>
		  <p>The command shows the UUID's for all drives and their partitions.  
		  Find the one that corresponds to your FAT32 partition.</p>
		  <p>Take that UUID and use it to create a new entry in the /etc/fstab file.  
		  First, we will create a backup copy of the file with this command:</p>
		  <p><b>sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak</b></p>
		  <p>While still in the terminal, type this command to open the /etc/fstab
		  in your text editor:</p>
		  <p><b>sudo leafpad /etc/fstab</b></p>
		  <p>The file will be opened in the editor and you can now add your entries
		  for the FAT32 partition.  This example will use the UUID "9CEC-37E5".
		  (Substitute your correct UUID in place of the example's.)</p>
		  <p>Add the following two lines to your /etc/fstab file:</p>
		  <p><strong># FAT32 Drive<br />
		  UUID=9CEC-37E5 /home/user/fatfiles vfat 
		  defaults,uid=1000,gid=100,umask=007 0 0</strong></p>

            Lets begin.</p>
          <p> Boot up your computer and immediately press and hold down the 
		  Shift key. You should see a screen like this.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass1.png" /></p>
          <p> Next press the <b>e</b> key whilst that top line is highlighted.

            Use your arrow keys to move down to the line highlighted in the 
		  picture below. Use the arrow key until you reach the end of that line.</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass2.png" /></p>
          <p> Press the backspace key repeatedly until you remove: <b>ro splash

          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass3.png" /></p>
          <p> Now press either <b>F10</b> or <b>Ctrl+X</b> to boot your machine

          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass4.png" /></p>

          <p> Your password has now been changed. Now we are ready to save those

          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/pass7.png" /></p>
          <p> Your computer will reboot. If you see the screen shown below

			<p> <font size="4"><a name="terminal"></a><b>Terminal Basics</b></font></p>
          <p> Linux Lite is designed to be such that new users won't have to 
		  venture into the terminal to much. But, there will be some occasions 
		  where we need to run the odd terminal command. The following is a very 
		  basic introduction to some of the more common terminal commands that 
		  will help you to navigate around your computer, should you need to.</p>
          <p> <b>TIP: instead of typing out the entire name of a file or folder, 
		  type the first few letters and hit your TAB key, this will auto 
		  complete the name. This will save you lots of time but be careful and 
		  make sure you have typed the correct file name. In the examples below 
		  'directory' also means 'folder'.</b></p>
		    <p>When you first open a terminal, your location in the file system will
		    be your home directory.  You can confirm that by using the first command
		    listed below, "<strong>pwd</strong>".  It will show that you are in "/home/username", where
		    "username" is your actual username.</p>
		    <p> <b>pwd</b> - shows you the present working directory (the directory you are
		    currently in).  If you get lost, just type "pwd" and it will tell you where you
		    are in the file system.</p>
		    <p> <b>ls</b> - display a list of files and directories in the current directory</p>
          <p> <b>ls -la</b> - a more comprehensive listing that displays file properties in 
		  	 the current directory, including hidden files and their properties.</p>
          <p> <b>cd</b> - change directory, change to another directory.  For instance, if
          you are currently located at /home/username and want to go to your Documents folder, 
          type:  <b>cd Documents</b>.  If you then type <b>pwd</b>, you will see that your
          location is now <b>/home/username/Documents</b>.</p>
          <p> <b>cd ..</b> - go back one directory (up to parent directory of your
          current location).</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics1.png" /></p>
          <p> <b>cp</b> - copy file to another directory</p>
          <p> <b>rm</b> - remove a file or directory</p>
          <p> <b>rm -rf</b> - permanently delete a file or directory</p>
          <p> <b>mv</b> - rename a file or directory.<br />
            You can also use it to move a file from one location to another eg.
            <b>mv /home/jerry/file1.doc /home/jerry/Documents</b></p>
          <p> <b>cat</b> - display the contents inside a file</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics2.png" /></p>
          <p> <b>mkdir</b> - make a new folder</p>
          <p> <b>rmdir</b> - remove a folder</p>
          <p> <b>killall</b> - kill a program with that name</p>
          <p> <b>man</b> - read the manual for a particular program (type <b>q</b>
            to exit the manual)</p>
          <p> <img border="0" src="img/installer/term-basics3.png" /></p>

            There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite. Go to <b>
		  Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>.<br />
            There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of 
		  these settings - <b>Appearance</b> and <b>Window Manager</b>.</p>
          <p><img border="0" src="img/installer/themes-01.png" /></p>
			<p>Click on <b>Appearance</b>. Here you will see the <b>Style</b> and

			<p><img border="0" src="img/installer/themes-02.png" /></p>
          <p><img border="0" src="img/installer/themes-03.png" /></p>
          <p>As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will 
		  notice visual changes on your computer.<br />
            Close <b>Settings Manager</b> before moving onto the next part of

          <p><b>NOTE: Not all themes from there will work as you would expect,

		  method to the one shown here. Click <a href="software.html#ppa">here</a>
              for more information on how to install a new PPA. Whichever theme 
		  you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE compatibility.</b></p>
          <p>The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder. Click on
            <b>View, Show Hidden Files</b>.<br />
            Right click somewhere in your home folder, <b>Create Folder</b>, 
		  make a folder called <b>.themes </b>(you will only need to do this 
		  once.) This is where we will copy the new theme to.</p>
          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes-04.png" /></p>
          <p>Download a theme of your choosing. In this example we will choose 
		  the <a href="http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Redbird?content=158228"
              target="_blank">Redbird</a> theme.</p>
          <p><b>NOTE: Each theme may come with a specific set of install 
		  instructions, if they do, please follow those instructions.</b></p>

          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes-06.png" /></p>
          <p>Now go to <b>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</b>. There are 2

		  Manager</b>.</p>
          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes-01.png" /></p>
          <p>First we'll click into <b>Appearance</b>. Select <b>Redbird</b>

          <p><img border="1" src="img/installer/themes-07.png" /></p>
          <p>Click on <b>Overview</b> in the bottom left to go back to the <b>
