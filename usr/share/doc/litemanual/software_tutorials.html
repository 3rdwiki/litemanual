				<p>This page is a work in progress.  Over time more tutorials will be added
				to it.  Some of them may deal with software that is already included in the
				standard Linux Lite installation.  Many will be for software that needs to
				be installed first because it is not part of the standard installation. Two
				choices listed under <strong>Menu -> System</strong> will be used frequently
				for installing software.  Below are pictures of both for your reference in 
				the tutorials.  (If a tutorial requires something different from these, it
				will contain screenshots for that specific situation.)</p>
				<br />
				<p>What you will see when installing from <strong>Menu ->System ->
				Install Additional Software</strong>:</p>

				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>  The menu you see for '<strong>Install Additional Software</strong>'
				may be different than shown here because of new software additions over time.</p>
				<p>What you will see when installing from <strong>Menu -> System ->
				Install/Remove Software</strong> (Synaptic Package Manager).</p>

				<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="keepassx">KeePassX</a></font></strong></p>
				<p>KeePassX is a password manager program used for securely creating and storing
				passwords.  It includes a password generator that will create strong passwords
				for you.  When using KeePassX, you only need to remember one password - the one
				you use for opening the program!  Once your KeePassX data file is opened,
				transferring a password from the program to its entry form is done quickly
				and easily with a few mouse clicks.</p>
				<p>To install, go to <strong>Menu -> System -> Install Additional Programs</strong>, 
				type the number corresponding to KeePassX from the list shown in the pop-up window 
				and enter your password when prompted for it.</p>
				<p>After it's installed you can start it from <strong>Menu -> Accessories ->
				KeePassX</strong>.  On your first startup you will need to create a new database
				for your passwords - click the interface button for that in the upper-left corner.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-01.png" border="1" alt="keepassx-01.png" /></p>
				<p>You will then be prompted to make a master password for the database that will
				contain your passwords.  This is the only password you will need to remember.
				Do your best to make one that you not only can remember, but is strong also.  Make
				it reasonably long with a combination of letters, numbers and other characters
				if possible.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-02.png" alt="keepassx-02.png" /></p>
				<p>After entering your password you will see that the database is now populated
				with two <strong>groups</strong> shown on the left: <strong>Internet</strong> and
				<strong>eMail</strong>.  Groups are just ways to organize your passwords according
				to their use.  (You can edit, delete and create new groups by clicking <strong>'Groups'</strong>
				along the top of the window.)</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-03.png" alt="keepassx-03.png" /></p>
				<p>To create a password entry, click the '<strong>Add New Entry</strong>' button along the top.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-04.png" border="1" alt="keepassx-04.png" /></p>
				<p>Select which group the password should fall under, fill-in your information, 
				then enter your password (if you already have one) or click on the <strong>'Gen'</strong>
				button to bring up the <strong>Password Generator</strong> to make one for you.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-05.png" alt="keepassx-05.png" /></p>
				<p>In the <strong>Password Generator</strong> you can specify the types of characters
				to include, the password length, etc. along with the option to enable entropy
				collection to further strengthen the password.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-06.png" alt="keepassx-06.png" /></p>
				<p>If you enable <strong>entropy collection</strong> move your mouse around randomly
				when the collection window pops up.  The mouse data will be incorporated by the 
				algorithm to produce the random password.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-07.png" alt="keepassx-07.png" /></p>
				<p>When it's done, hit '<strong>OK</strong>' and it will fill-in the password it produced for you. 
				If you would like to see it, click the eye symbol next to the password box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-08.png" alt="keepassx-08.png" /></p>
				<p>Click '<strong>OK</strong>' when you are satisfied with everything and your new password entry
				will now appear in the list for the group you put it under.  When you are done
				making your entries (or changes to existing ones), make sure save everything by
				clicking to click the <strong>Save Database</strong> button along the top of the
				window.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-09.png" alt="keepassx-09.png" /></p>
				<p>A dialog box will pop-up for you to specify a name for the file and where to
				save it.  It will automatically put the '.kdb' (keepassx data base) extension on
				the file name and it will default to saving it in your home folder.  (You can
				designate a different location to save to if you'd like.)  So the example
				below will save a file called 'my-keepassx-data.kdb' under /home/bill.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/keepassx/keepassx-10.png" alt="keepassx-10.png" /></p>
				<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong><br />
				<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be sure to make at least one extra copy
				of your '.kdb' file to an external source, like a USB backup stick.</span>  If 
				your hard drive fails, or something else goes wrong that prevents you from 
				retrieving your files you will lose all of your passwords and access to the 
				accounts you set them for.  That will not be a pleasant experience if you don't
				have a backup copy made - so do that immediately and update it everytime you make
				changes to the database.</p>
				<p><strong>Using KeePassX is simple!</strong></p>  
				<p>Start KeePassX and highlight the site you want to log into.  Navigate to the website,
				then click the <strong>person icon</strong> along the top of the KeePassX window to
				copy your username to the clipboard temporarily.  Right-click in the website entry field
				for it and paste.  Click the <strong>key icon</strong> (next to the person icon) to 
				copy the password to the clipboard and paste it into the website password field.  That's
				all there is to it!  (Note:  the information is automatically deleted from the clipboard
				after 20 seconds.  You can change that and other settings by going to 
				<strong>Extras -> Settings -> Security</strong>.)</p>

				<!-- <p><strong><font size="4"><a name="plank">Plank Dock</a></font></strong></p>
				<p>Plank is a lightweight docking application for program launchers and works
				well with the Xfce desktop used in Linux Lite.  Conveniently add launchers for
				all of your favorite programs on the launcher for quick, easy access.  The Plank
				dock can be positioned along any edge of the screen.  You can start the dock
				from the main menu or have it start automatically upon boot-up of the computer.</p>
				<p>Plank is one of the applications you can add easily from the <strong>Install
				Additional Software</strong> section in the <strong>Menu</strong>.  The Plank
				installer in Linux Lite will also download and install many different themes
				for the dock and put a dark <strong>plank-themer-ondock</strong> icon on the
				dock, which you can click to list and choose from the different themes.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/themer_icon.png" alt="themer_icon.png" /></p>
				<p>The dock themes will not display properly unless <i>compositing</i> is enabled;
				so do the following to make sure you have it enabled.</p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu -> Settings -> Settings Manager</strong>, then choose
				<strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/win_mgr_tweaks.png" alt="win_mgr_tweaks.png" /></p>
				<p>Click the <strong>Compositor</strong> tab and click '<strong>Enable display compositing</strong>'.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/compositor.png" alt="compositor.png" /></p>
				<p>Now you're ready to install Plank.  Go to <strong>Menu -> System -> 
				Install Additional Software</strong> and choose <strong>Plank Dock</strong> from
				the applications listed in the pop-up.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/install_plank.png" alt="install_plank.png" /></p>
				<p>When installation is complete you will find <strong>Plank</strong> listed under
				<strong>Menu -> Accessories</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/menu_plank.png" alt="menu_plank.png" /></p>
				<p><strong>POSITIONING THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>Plank's default position is centered along the bottom of your screen display.
				If your panel is also along the bottom it will block part of the dock.  You will
				need to move either the dock or the panel to a different position.  Either one
				of them can be moved to the top, bottom, or either side of the screen.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank-01.png" border="1" alt="plank-01.png" /></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Panel:</span></strong>
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Right-click an empty area on the panel</li>
							<li>Choose: <strong>Panel -> Panel Preferences -> Display (tab)</strong></li>
							<li>Uncheck the "Lock Panel" box</li>
							<li>With mouse, grab either <u>end</u> of the panel to move it</li>
							<li>Lock the panel again after move to new position</li>
							<li>Note:  change <strong>'Mode'</strong> to 'Deskbar' or 'Vertical' if you want the
							panel on one of the sides of the display.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<br />
					<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To Move the Plank Dock:</span></strong>
					<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Open your file manager, click <strong>View -> Show Hidden Files</strong></li>
							<li>Navigate to <strong>.config/plank/dock1</strong> and open the <strong>settings</strong>
							file (with <strong>leafpad</strong> text editor).</li>
							<li>Or, from <strong>Terminal</strong> enter this command:  <code>
							<span class="auto-style1"><strong>leafpad 
							~/.config/plank/dock1/settings</strong></span></code></li>
							<li>In opened <strong>settings</strong> file (see pic below under 'All Other Plank
							Dock Settings' heading):
								<ul>
									<li>Change value in line #18 according to the description on previous line #17</li>
									<li>Save the file</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>If setting did not take immediate effect, right-click the <strong>Plank</strong>
							icon on the dock and select 'Quit' to close the dock.</li>
							<li>Re-start the dock from <strong>Menu -> Accessories -> Plank</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-1.png" alt="plank_settings-1.png" /></p>
				<p>After the move operation you will be able to see the dock properly.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank-02.png" border="1" alt="plank-02.png" /></p>
				<p><strong>ADDING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS TO THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>When you open a program from the Menu it will then appear on the dock.  When you close
				the application its icon will then disappear from the dock.  For programs you use often,
				you'll want to keep them on the dock for easy access so you don't need to navigate the
				Menu.  There are two basic ways to accomplish that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open a program through the <strong>Menu</strong>, right-click the icon that appears
					on the dock and choose 'Keep in Dock'.</li>
					<li>Open the <strong>Menu</strong>, find program to add, then drag it and drop it
					on the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p><strong>REMOVING PROGRAM LAUNCHERS FROM THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>Two ways to remove items from the dock are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Right-click the launcher icon and un-select 'Keep on Dock'.</li>
					<li>Simply grab, drag and drop the icon somewhere off of the dock.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p><strong>ARRANGING LAUNCHER POSITIONS ON THE DOCK</strong></p>
				<p>You can change the order of items on the dock by grabbing them with
				your mouse and moving them to the right or left and dropping them
				into place.  The dark <strong>plank-themer-ondock</strong> icon is
				the only one you can not grab.  To change its position on the dock,
				move the other icons to its left or right until it ends up where you'd
				like it to reside.</p>
				<p><strong>CHANGING THE DOCK'S THEME</strong></p>
				<p>Click on the dark <strong>themer</strong> icon to see a list of almost
				30 themes to choose from.  Click the one you want and the dock will 
				change to it without the need for a restart of Plank. Here are a few
				theme examples.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-1.png" border="1" alt="theme-1.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-2.png" border="1" alt="theme-2.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-3.png" border="1" alt="theme-3.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-4.png" border="1" alt="theme-4.png" /></p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/theme-5.png" border="1" alt="theme-5.png" /></p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>LAUNCHING MORE THAN ONE INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM</strong></p>
				<p>When you click the launcher of a program that is already running, it
				will bring that running window into focus on the screen (bring it to
				the foreground).  If instead you would like to launch another instance of
				the program then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Middle mouse click on the launcher icon, or</li>
					<li>Use 'Ctrl' key while left-clicking the icon with your mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p><strong>SETUP PLANK TO START AUTOMATICALLY ON BOOT</strong></p>
				<p>Go to <strong>Menu -> Settings -> Session and Startup -> Application
				Autostart (tab)</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hit '+' button to add new startup entry</li>
					<li><strong>Name</strong> = Plank Dock</li>
					<li><strong>Description</strong> = Start Plank dock on startup</li>
					<li><strong>Command</strong> = plank</li>
					<li>Click 'OK' when done</li>
				</ul><br />
				<p>Close the <strong>Session and Startup</strong> window when done.  Your next
				reboot will start Plank automatically.</p><br />
				<p><strong>ALL OTHER PLANK DOCK SETTINGS</strong></p>
				<p>All other settings can be adjusted through the dock's <strong>
				settings</strong>
				file.  Use your file manager or the terminal to open file located in the
				<code><span class="auto-style1"><strong>~/.config/plank/dock1</strong></span></code> directory.  (Remember to set file manager
				to 'View Hidden Files'.)  You can edit various lines in the file to make your changes.
				If changes do not take effect immediately after saving the changed file, quit and
				restart Plank.  Please refer to the following picture while reading about the various
				settings that can be changed.</p>
				<p>(Note: we hope to have a working GUI interface for these settings available
				within a couple of months, time permitting.)</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/plank_dock/plank_settings-2.png" alt="plank_settings-2.png" /></p>
				<p>Changes that you can make by editing the <strong>settings</strong> 
				file are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>(Lines #5-6) Show only windows of the current workspace on the dock.
						<ul>
							<li>False = icons show on dock for programs opened on any workspace</li>
							<li>True = only icons for the current workspace show on the dock</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #7-8) Change the size of the launcher icons on the dock</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #9-12) Control hiding behavior and time delay for hiding the dock</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #13-14) Set which monitor to show the dock on if you have more than one.</li>
					<li>(Lines #15-16) DO NOT MODIFY</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #17-18) Specify which edge of the screen to position dock on.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #19-20) Offset the dock from center position
						<ul>
							<li>20 would offset the dock to the right of center by 20 percent</li>
							<li>-20 would offset the dock to the left of center by 20 percent</li>
						</ul>
					</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #21-22) Name of dock theme to use.  This is handled automatically
					by using the <strong>themer</strong> icon on the dock.<br />
					You can change themes
					manually here if you need to.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines #23-24) Change the dock alignment on the screen edge it is on.
					For example, if you have the dock along the bottom edge, you can center it,
					align left, or align it right.  You can also choose 'panel-mode' to make the
					dock appear like a panel instead of a dock.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 25-26) If 'panel-mode' was chosen, you can align the launcher icons
					on the panel</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 27-28) Enable or disable the ability to drag and drop items from the
					panel for deletion.  If you find that you have problems accidentally dragging things
					off the dock and deleting them, change this setting.</li><br />
					<li>(Lines 29-30) Pressure-based revealing of the dock if that is supported.</li>

				<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="vbox">Virtual Box</a></font></strong></p>
				<p>The VirtualBox (VBox) program allows you to run other OS's (operating systems)
				within your main OS by creating a container of sorts for them to run in, independently
				from the main OS.  You install other OS's to VBox just like you would to a normal
				hard drive.  VBox creates a virtual hard drive for you to install to and the result
				is referred to as a Virtual Machine (VM).</p>
				<p>You can install to VBox using a bootable CD or DVD. Even more conveniently, you
				can install using a downloaded ISO file without the need to burn it first to a
				CD/DVD.  You can also just boot ISO files and run them as a live environment -- 
				just as you would booting your computer from a live CD/DVD/USB -- without installing
				it if you prefer.</p>
				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some common uses for VBox are:</span>
					<ul>
						<li>Install a second copy of your main OS for testing and experimentation.</li>
						<li>Install other Linux distros that you want to use regularly, but do
						not want to install as a dual-boot on your computer.</li>
						<li>Install, or just run live, other distros for testing purposes.</li>
						<li>Install Windows so you can run its programs within Linux without
						rebooting the computer.  (Note: Microsoft considers that to be a separate
						installation of its software and requires another user license for that.)</li>
					</ul>
				</p><br />
				<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Installing VirtualBox</span></strong></p>
				<p>To install VBox, go to <strong>Menu -> System -> Install Additional Software</strong>
				and find it from the list of software to install.  Enter its corresponding number
				and your password when asked for it.  VirtualBox will take a couple of minutes to
				fully install, so just wait until the screen tells you it is done.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-01.png" alt="vbox-01.png" /></p>
				<p>After installation is complete, you will find VBox under both the <strong>Accessories</strong>
				and <strong>System</strong> sections of the <strong>Menu</strong>.</p>
				<p>VBox does not come pre-configured to use USB sticks.  You need to download an extra
				package for that from their website.  Go ahead and start VBox, then follow the steps
				below to install what you need for USB support.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You need to know the version number of your VBox installation in order to
						download the matching "<strong>Extension Pack</strong>".  It should be version
						4.3.10; but double-check that by clicking <strong>Help -> About VirtualBox</strong>
						from the main VBox window.  Then look along bottom of pop-up window for the
						version number.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-02.png" border="1" alt="vbox-02.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-03.png" border="1" alt="vbox-03.png" /><br />
						<p>&nbsp</p>
						<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For version 4.3.10</span>, go to 
						<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3/" >this
						VirtualBox webpage</a>.  Otherwise, go <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" >
						here</a>, look for your version number and follow same steps as below to continue.<br /><br />
							<ul>
								<li>Find the "<strong>Extension Pack</strong>" listed under the heading for your
								VirtualBox version and click on "<strong>All Platforms</strong>" to download it.
								Save the download to your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder.</li><br />
								<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-04.png" border="1" alt="vbox-04.png" /><br />
								<br />
								<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-05.png" alt="vbox-05.png" /><br />
								<br />
								<li>Once downloaded, in VBox main window, go to <strong>File -> Preferences</strong>
								and click <strong>Extensions</strong> on the left side.</li><br />
								<li>Look to the right side of the window and you will see two icons.  Click
								the top icon to "Add Package".</li><br />
								<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-06.png" alt="vbox-06.png" /><br />
								<br />
								<li>It will open your <strong>Downloads</strong> folder.  Click to highlight
								the extension pack you just downloaded.  Hit "Open" to install it to VBox.</li><br />
								<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-07.png" alt="vbox-07.png" /><br />

				<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using VirtualBox</span></strong></p>
				<p>VBox can boot from either a live CD/DVD or an ISO file saved to your hard drive (HDD).
				In the following example we'll use a downloaded ISO file.  If you are using a bootable
				CD/DVD, go ahead and load it into the tray before we get started.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>From main VBox window, click the <strong>New</strong> button to make a new virtual
						machine environment.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-11.png" border="1" alt="vbox-11.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>Next, choose a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">name</span> for the virtual
						machine, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">type</span> of operating system
						it	will be, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">version</span> of the
						operating system.  When filling in version, specify either 32 or 64-bit system and
						choose the closest fit for the OS you will be installing if you don't see a listing
						that matches exactly under the "Version" drop-down box.</li><br />
						
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-12.png" alt="vbox-12.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>In this example, we will make a new machine for another Ubuntu-based distro called
						"Voyager" and we are using its 64-bit version.  There is no listing for Voyager, so
						we'll just choose "Ubuntu 64-bit" because that is what it is based on.  (If you made a
						virtual machine [VM] with Linux Lite installed, you would also choose Ubuntu for the
						same reason.)  Click 'Next' to continue.</li><br />
						<li>Decide how much of your RAM (memory) you want dedicated to operating the VM.
						512MB-2GB will likely be fine most of the time.  Do not dedicate more than half
						of your RAM to the VM -- that could cause problems with the operation of your
						host OS, Linux Lite.  (The VM is operating from within the host OS -- you don't
						want the VM using more resources than the host itself.)  In this example, the
						computer has 8GB of RAM, so 2GB was allotted to the VM.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-13.png" alt="vbox-13.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>The next screen asks if you want to create a virtual hard drive?  That is what we
						want, so we tick that radio button and click "Create".</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-14.png" alt="vbox-14.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>We'll choose "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" from the Hard Drive File Type
						screen.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-15.png" alt="vbox-15.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>We'll choose 'Dynamically allocated' from the Storage on physical hard drive
						screen.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-16.png" alt="vbox-16.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>On the next screen we make the virtual drive 10GB.  (VBox will dedicate
						space from your hard drive for the virtual drive -- so be sure you have enough
						room on your HDD to accomodate creating the virtual drive.)</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-17.png" alt="vbox-17.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>After hitting 'Create' your new VM will be listed along the left-hand side
						of the main VBox window.  (At this point, it is just an empty container.)</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-18.png" border="1" alt="vbox-18.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>You can adjust a few settings for the VM either before or after installing
						the OS.  We'll do it before installation.  Highlight the VM and click
						"<strong>Settings</strong>".  Then, click "<strong>Display</strong>" along the
						left side and adjust the amount of video memory you want the VM to have. (Default
						is 12MB; we'll give it 64MB in this example.)  Also, click to enable either
						<strong>3-D</strong> or <strong>2-D</strong> acceleration.  (If one give you an
						"invalid settings" message, unclick it and choose the other.)</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-19.png" alt="vbox-19.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>Now, click "<strong>USB</strong>" on the left side and make sure that the
						USB controllers are enabled.  This will allow you to copy to/from USB sticks
						in the VM.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-20.png" border="1" alt="vbox-20.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> when done to get back to main window.</li><br />
						<li>With the VM highlighted on the left of main window, click <strong>Start</strong> arrow to begin
						installation.</li><br />
						<li>The first screen you see will ask you what to use as your installation source
						and the CD/DVD drive will likely be already listed.  If that is what you are using
						and the disk is loaded in the tray, go ahead and hit 'Start'.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-21.png" alt="vbox-21.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>In this example, we are using an ISO file that has been downloaded to the hard
						drive.  For that, click the icon to the right of the CD/DVD drive box to bring up
						a window for navigating to the location where you saved the ISO file.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-22.png" alt="vbox-22.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>After you've found and selected your ISO, it will appear filled in the source
						box.  Hit <strong>Start</strong> and it will now boot from the live ISO/CD/DVD.</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-23.png" alt="vbox-23.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>When the live environment finishes loading, click the install icon on the desktop
						to begin the installer.  The installation process is just the same as if you were
						installing to the computer normally.  All references on the "Installation Type"
						screen are to the virtual hard drive.  When asked if you want to "Erase disk and
						install", it is NOT going to erase your real hard drive -- it is talking about the
						virtual hard drive.  (Same thing if you choose 'Something else' and partition
						the drive manually.)</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-24.png" alt="vbox-24.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>After install is complete, reboot the VM.  If the installation disk appears
						to be stuck and not rebooting, click your mouse somewhere inside the VM window,
						then hit the <strong>ENTER</strong> key.  If nothing happens, click the "x" on
						the VM window and choose to "Shutdown" the machine.  Then just highlight the VM 
						and hit the <strong>Start</strong> arrow again.</li><br />
						<li>In the VM, you can do much the same as when installed for real on your
						computer.  You can install things, download updates, etc., and it all happens
						within the virtual environment on the virtual HDD.</li><br />
						<li>Whenever you want to shutdown a running VM, shutdown using the normal shutdown
						method of the OS in the VM -- not by closing the VM window.  (If the VM OS was Linux
						Lite, you would click <strong>Menu -> Logout -> Shutdown</strong>, just like
						on your computer.)</li>
					</ul><br />
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using USB's in VirtualBox</span></strong></p>
				<p>Assuming you've already added the the VBox "Extension Pack", to begin using USB's
				in your new VM, you need to add your username to the "<strong>vboxusers</strong>" group.
				(You only need to do that once; not for every individual VM you make.)  You should
				perform the following steps while no VM's are open.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Open the Linux Lite (not VBox) Settings Manager (Menu -> Settings -> Settings
						Manager) and select the "<strong>User Manager</strong>".</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-25.png" alt="vbox-25.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>With your username showing under "Select user", scroll down the list in the
						"<strong>Groups</strong>" column and place a check in the box next to
						"<strong>vboxusers</strong>" to add yourself to that group and hit
						"<strong>Apply</strong>".</li><br />
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-26.png" alt="vbox-26.png" /><br />
						<br />
						<li>Close out the User Manager and Settings Manager and start up your VM.</li><br />
						<li>Once up and running you will see a little <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
						USB icon</span> along bottom right edge of the VBox window.  Right-click on it to
						choose the USB you want to use.</li><br />
					
						<img src="img/software_tutorials/virtualbox/vbox-27.png" alt="vbox-27.png" /><br />
