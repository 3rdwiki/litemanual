			<!-- New content -->
			<p>Linux Lite uses the Xfce desktop environment because we feel it strikes a good
			balance between resource useage, funtionality and customizability for the user.
			It's relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older
			computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems.</p>
			<p>Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward,
			intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows XP or Windows 7
			environment are used to.  At the same time, Xfce offers a variety of ways for people
			to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own
			tastes if that is what they want to do.</p>
			<p>That is what this section of the manual is all about.  If you get bored with
			the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways.  Linux
			Lite comes with an assortment of themes and icon sets pre-installed already and
			switching to one of those is quick and easy.  You can also download and apply other
			themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like.  The panel along
			the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons
			can be customized in a variety of ways too.</p>
			<p>In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your
			desktop and then give examples of additional programs that can be added to your
			system to really spice things up if you want to.</p>

	      <p><font size="4"><a name="themes"></a><strong>Themes &amp; Icon sets</strong></font></p>
	      <p>The default theme for Linux Lite is <strong>Mediterranean White</strong>.  The
	         default icon set is <strong>Faenza</strong>.<br />
	         There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite.  Go to <strong>Menu,
		 Settings, Settings Manager</strong>.<br />
		 There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings -
		 <strong>Appearance</strong> and <strong>Window Manager</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-01.png" /></p>
	      <p>Click on <strong>Appearance</strong>.  Here you will see the <strong>Style</strong>
		 and <strong>Icons</strong> tab.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-02.png" /></p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-03.png" /></p>
	      <p>As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes
		 on your computer.<br />
		 Close <strong>Settings Manager</strong> before moving onto the next part of this
		 tutorial.
	      </p>
	      <p>This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons.</p>
	      <p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>

	      <p><strong><font size="4"><a name="apply_theme"></a>Applying a new Theme</font></strong></p>
	      <p>Head over to the <a href="http://xfce-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=15x100x420"
				     target="_blank">XFCE Look</a> website and choose theme of
		 your liking.
	      </p>
	      <p><strong>NOTE:  Not all themes from there will work as you would expect.  Please
		 read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme.  Some make
		 installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here.
		 Click <a href="software.html#ppa">here</a> for more information on how to install
		 a new PPA.  Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE
		 compatibility.</strong>
	      </p>
	      <p>The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder.  Click on <strong>View,
		 Show Hidden Files</strong>.<br />
		 Right-click somewhere in your home folder, <strong>Create Folder</strong>, make
		 a folder called <strong>.themes</strong> (you will only need to do this once).
		 This is where we will copy the new theme to.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-04.png" /></p>
	      <p>Download a theme of your choosing.  In this example we will choose the
		 <a href="http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Redbird?content=158228" target=
		    "_blank">Redbird</a> theme.
	      </p>
	      <p><strong>NOTE:  Each theme may come with a specific set of install instructions.
		 If they do, please follow those instructions.</strong>
	      </p>
	      <p>Next, extract the theme you just downloaded (right-click, <strong>Extract
		 Here</strong>).
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-05.png" /></p>
	      <p>Copy the Redbird theme folder to the <strong>.themes</strong> folder in your
		 home folder.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-06.png" /></p>
	      <p>Now go to <strong>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</strong>.  There are 2
		 places we need to apply the new theme:  <strong>Appearance</strong> and 
		 <strong>Window Manager</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-01.png" /></p>
	      <p>First, we'll click into <strong>Appearance</strong>.  Select <strong>
		 Redbird</strong> from the list.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-07.png" /></p>
	      <p>Click on <strong>All Settings</strong> in the bottom right to go back to
		 the <strong>Settings Manager</strong>.<br />
		 Now click into <strong>Window Manager</strong> and select <strong>
		 Redbird</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-09.png" /></p>
	      <p>Let's click on <strong>Menu, Turn Off Computer</strong> and <strong>Log Out
		 </strong>.<br />
		 Log in again and our new theme now displays properly.
