				Linux Lite uses the XFCE desktop environment because it strikes a good balance
				between resource usage, functionality and customizability for the user.  It's
				relatively light on resources which makes it suitable for installation on older
				computers, giving them a new lease on life, as well as on newer systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Navigating the applications menu and the file system is straightforward,
				intuitive and is similar to what many people coming from a Windows XP or Windows 7
				environment are used to.  At the same time, XFCE offers a variety of ways for people
				to customize the look and feel of their desktop work environment to suit their own
				tastes if that is what they want to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is what this section of the manual is all about.  If you get bored with
				the default setup, you can change it to your liking in a variety of ways.  Linux
				Lite comes with an assortment of themes and icon sets pre-installed already and
				switching to one of those is quick and easy.  You can also download and apply other
				themes, icons and mouse pointers to your system if you'd like.  The panel along
				the bottom of your screen that holds the Menu launcher and various indicator icons
				can be customized in a variety of ways too.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this section, we'll start off with the more basic ways to customize your
				desktop and then give examples of additional programs that can be added to your
				system to spice things up a bit more if you want to.
			</p><br /><br />
			
			<p><font size="4"><a name="desktop"></a><strong>Desktop settings basics</strong></font></p>
			<p>
				Some of the most basic changes people like to do are changing the desktop
				background (wallpaper), deciding whether or not to have certain icons show on
				the desktop and sometimes they may want to change something about the menu
				shown when right or middle clicking on the desktop.  <strong>Desktop Settings
				</strong> is where to look for making those types of changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two ways to access the <strong>Desktop Settings</strong> menu.  One
				way is to simply right-click on the desktop and choose <strong>Desktop
				Settings</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/desktop-01.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Another way is to choose <strong>Desktop</strong> from the main <strong>Settings
				Manager</strong> window, which can be accessed by going to <strong>Menu ->
				Settings -> Settings Manager</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/desktop-02.png" /></p>
			<p>
				First, we will look at the <strong>Background</strong> tab under <strong>
				Desktop Settings</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/desktop-03.png" /></p>
			<p>
				By default, backgrounds are stored in the file system under the
				<code>/</code>usr/share/backgrounds/xfce folder.  Images in that folder
				are shown as choices in the <strong>Backgrounds</strong> tab.  Just
				click on the image you want and it will instantly switch to that for
				your background.  If you want to add some of your own pictures to the
				choices, open your file manager <strong>As Administrator</strong>, enter
				your password, then navigate to that folder and paste your image into it.
			</p>
			<p>
				(<strong>HINT:</strong>  You can just right-click your desktop, choose
				<strong>Open as Administrator</strong>, enter your password and it will
				open the Thunar file manager at your Desktop folder.  From there, just
				navigate to where your picture is stored, copy it, then navigate to <code>
				<span class="auto-style1">/usr/share/backgrounds/xfce</span></code> and paste it in.)
			</p>
			<p>
				If you prefer, you can change the folder location that the <strong>
				Background</strong> tab defaults to for choices.  For example, if you have a
				folder called "Wallpapers" under your Home folder, you can tell the system
				to look there instead.  Click the drop-down box next to the word <strong>
				Folder:</strong> and pick <strong>Other</strong> to navigate your way to
				<code><span class="auto-style1">/home/yourname/Wallpapers</span></code>.  Some people prefer doing this
				because it eliminates the need to be <strong>Administrator</strong> when
				adding new backgrounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a few other options associated with the background images.  You
				can choose from different styles to display them in, choose a background
				color if they do not cover the entire screen, have the backgrounds change
				after a certain amount of time and whether or not you want to have the
				same background on each workspace.  If you decide to have a different
				background for each workspace, uncheck the <strong>Apply to all
				workspaces</strong> box, pick a wallpaper for the workspace you are on,
				then drag the window to another workspace and select a new wallpaper for
				it there.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				Now let's take a look at the <strong>Menu</strong> tab under <strong>
				Desktop Settings</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/desktop-04.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Under <strong>Desktop Menu</strong>, it is asking if you want an applications
				menu to show up as a choice when you right-click on the desktop and whether you
				want that menu to show the icons for the applications listed, or just their names.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/desktop-05.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Under <strong>Window List Menu</strong>, it is asking how you want things to
				show when you middle-click on the desktop.  Here is an example showing how
				thing are listed using the default settings as shown above while a few program
				windows are opened on different workspaces.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/desktop-06.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				Lastly, under the <strong>Icons</strong> tab you can change various settings
				regarding the icons on the desktop -- their size, whether to activate them
				with a single, or double-click, etc.  Under <strong>Default Icons</strong>
				you can choose whether or not to show certain default icons on the desktop.

	      <p><font size="4"><a name="workspaces"></a><strong>Workspace settings</strong></font></p>
	      <p>
	      	If you are new to Linux, the concept of <strong>workspaces</strong> may be
	      	unfamiliar. Basically workspaces are virtual desktops that you can use to
	      	spread your work over.  Linux Lite has two workspaces activated by default,
	      	but you can change that to any number you like.  If you look to the right
	      	side of your lower panel you will notice two rectangles.  Those are
	      	representations of your available workspaces as shown by the <strong>
	      	Workspaces plugin</strong> on the panel.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/workspaces-01.png" /></p>
	      <p>
	      	Workspaces are particularly useful if you tend to have multiple programs
	      	open at the same time.  For example, if you have two programs running in
	      	one workspace and want to open a few more, switching to another workspace
	      	gives you a fresh, clean desktop to put them on.  This cuts down on desktop
	      	clutter and many find it easier to just switch workspaces rather than
	      	fumbling through multiple windows on the same desktop to find the one you
	      	want.  Here are four screenshots that show the difference.
	      </p>
	      <p>First -- five program windows opened on same workspace.</p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/workspaces-02.png" /></p>
	      <p>Next -- what you see when you switch to a new workspace.</p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/workspaces-03.png" /></p>
	      <p>Last -- workspace 1 with some programs on it and workspace 2 with the others.</p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/workspaces-04.png" /></p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/workspaces-05.png" /></p>
	      <p>
	      	With your work spread out over more than one workspace everything is
	      	easier to see.  Depending on your settings, switching between workspaces
	      	is typically done by either clicking one of the rectangles in the panel,
	      	using your mouse wheel while hovering over the rectangles, or using your
	      	mouse wheel on an empty spot of the desktop to scroll back and forth
	      	between workspaces.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      	There are three areas where workspace settings can be changed. You can
	      	right click the <strong>Workspaces plugin</strong> on the panel and choose
	      	<strong>Properties</strong>.  That brings up the <strong>Workspace
	      	Switcher</strong> window.  Some setting are found there and others appear
	      	when you subsequently click on <strong>Workspace Settings...</strong>. In
	      	the example below, we will set up four workspaces and have the Workspaces
	      	plugin display them in two rows instead of one on the panel.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/workspaces-06.png" /></p>
	      <p>
	      	You can also go to the main <strong>Settings Manager</strong>, choose <strong>
	      	Workspaces</strong> there and that will allow you to change the number
	      	of workspaces, their names and margins (if desired).
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/workspaces-07.png" /></p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/workspaces-08.png" /></p>
	      <p>
	      	Lastly, there are some more workspace settings within the
	      	<a href="#tweaks" /><strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong></a> section.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
	      <hr />
	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p><font size="4"><a name="themes"></a><strong>Themes &amp; Icon sets</strong></font></p>
	      <p>The default theme for Linux Lite is <strong>Mediterranean White</strong>.  The
	         default icon set is <strong>Faenza</strong>.<br />
	         There are some additional Theme and Icon sets in Linux Lite.  Go to <strong>Menu,
		 Settings, Settings Manager</strong>.<br />
		 There are 2 main areas in the Settings Manager that take care of these settings -
		 <strong>Appearance</strong> and <strong>Window Manager</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-01.png" /></p>
	      <p>Click on <strong>Appearance</strong>.  Here you will see the <strong>Style</strong>
		 and <strong>Icons</strong> tab.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-02.png" /></p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-03.png" /></p>
	      <p>As you click through the various themes and icon sets you will notice visual changes
		 	on your computer.</p>
		 	<p>
		 		Click <strong>All Settings</strong> to get back to the main <strong>Settings
		 		Manager</strong> window; then select <strong>Window Manager</strong>.  The
		 		<strong>Style</strong> tab will display available themes that tweak the look
		 		of open window frames and the minimize/maximize/close buttons in the windows.
		 	</p>
		 	<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-03b.png" /></p>
		 	<p>
		 		Click through some of the choices to see how things change.  Go back to the
		 		<strong>Appearance</strong> settings, pick a new theme, then come back to
		 		the <strong>Window Manager</strong> settings and go through choices again.
		 		You may notice that the <strong>Window Manager</strong> settings look slightly
		 		different depending on which <strong>Appearance</strong> theme you choose.
		 		Experiment with different combinations to find one you like.
		 	</p>
		 	<p>Close <strong>Settings Manager</strong> before moving onto the next part of this
		 	tutorial.

	      <p>This next section will show you how to apply new themes and icons.</p>

				     target="_blank">XFCE Look</a> website and choose theme of
		 your liking.
	      </p>
	      <p><strong>NOTE:  Not all themes from there will work as you would expect.  Please
		 read all of the documentation before attempting to apply a new theme.  Some make
		 installation easy via a PPA, which is a preferable method to the one shown here.
		 Click <a href="software.html#ppa">here</a> for more information on how to install
		 a new PPA.  Whichever theme you choose, make sure that it mentions XFCE
		 compatibility.</strong>
	      </p>
	      <p>The first thing we need to do is open up our home folder.  Click on <strong>View,
		 Show Hidden Files</strong>.<br />
		 Right-click somewhere in your home folder, <strong>Create Folder</strong>, make
		 a folder called <strong>.themes</strong> (you will only need to do this once).
		 This is where we will copy the new theme to.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="1" src="img/customize/themes-04.png" /></p>
	      <p>Download a theme of your choosing.  In this example we will choose the
		 <a href="http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Redbird?content=158228" target=
		    "_blank">Redbird</a> theme.
	      </p>
	      <p><strong>NOTE:  Each theme may come with a specific set of install instructions.
		 If they do, please follow those instructions.</strong>
	      </p>
	      <p>Next, extract the theme you just downloaded (right-click, <strong>Extract
		 Here</strong>).
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-05.png" /></p>

		 home folder.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-06.png" /></p>
	      <p>Now go to <strong>Menu, Settings, Settings Manager</strong>.  There are 2
		 places we need to apply the new theme:  <strong>Appearance</strong> and 
		 <strong>Window Manager</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-01.png" /></p>
	      <p>First, we'll click into <strong>Appearance</strong>.  Select <strong>
		 Redbird</strong> from the list.
	      </p>
	      <p><img border="0" src="img/customize/themes-07.png" /></p>
	      <p>Click on <strong>All Settings</strong> in the bottom right to go back to
		 the <strong>Settings Manager</strong>.</p>
		 	<p>
		 		Now click into <strong>Window Manager</strong> and select <strong>
				Redbird</strong>.  The new theme may not display properly until you log out
			 	and back in again, so do that now.  Click <strong>Menu -> Turn Off Computer ->
		 		Log Out</strong>.  Then log in again.  Notice the difference between the

	      	Theme</strong> tab and you will find your new theme there.  Click to select
	      	it and your mouse will immediately change.  Here is what it looks like.

			<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="panel">Customize your Panel bar</a></font></strong></p>
			<p>
				The panel bar along the bottom of your screen, (with your Menu and various
				indicator icons on it), can be customized in a variety of ways.  Its
				position and size can be changed.  Launchers and plugins can be added to it.
				You can even have multiple panels if you want to position certain items
				on different parts of the screen.  To get started, right-click on an empty
				area of the panel and select <strong>Panel -> Panel Preferences</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-01.png" /></p><br />
			<p>A <strong>Panel</strong> window will pop up where you can make your changes.
				The <strong>Display</strong> tab lets you choose to have the panel displayed
				horizontally, vertically, or as a deskbar on the screen.  You can choose to
				auto-hide the panel or not, change its length and width and move it to the top,
				bottom, or either side of the screen.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-02.png" /></p>
			<p>
				To move the panel you need to first unlock it, then you will see handles
				appear on either end of the panel that you can grab with your mouse to
				move it. Here is a close-up showing what the handles look like:
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-02b.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				The <strong>Appearance</strong> tab lets you choose a style for the panel,
				adjust the transparency (alpha) of the panel, or adjust the opacity of the
				panel depending on whether your mouse is pointing at it or not.  ("Compositing"
				needs to be enabled in order to change transparency and opacity settings.
				See the <a href="#tweaks"><strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong></a> section
				for how to do that.)
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-03.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				The <strong>Items</strong> tab is where you go to add things like launchers,
				plugins and separators to the panel.  Items on the panel are listed on the left
				and the buttons on the right allow you to change their position on the panel
				(up/down arrows), add (+) or delete (-) items, and edit details for them if
				necessary.  As you do that, you can see the changes take immediate effect on
				the panel.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-04.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Notice above that I created several launchers by using the <strong>+</strong>
				button, which opens an <strong>Add New Items</strong> window.  That window
				is where you can choose to add launchers, separators, and plugins that are
				available for the panel.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-08.png" /></p>
			<p>
				When you are done adding things, close the <strong>Add New Items</strong>
				window to get back to the <strong>Items</strong> tab of the <strong>
				Panel</strong> window.  To assign a program to a launcher, highlight the
				launcher item and click the button for "Edit the currently selected item".
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-04b.png" /></p>
			<p>That will bring up the <strong>Launcher</strong> window.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-11.png" /></p>
			<p>Hit the <strong>+</strong> button to bring up a list of programs to choose from.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-12.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				As an example, below is a panel with various changes made to it.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-05.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Note the following changes to the panel shown above:
				<ul>
					<li>the panel was moved to the top of the screen</li>
					<li>changed the Menu button to read as "Applications"</li>
					<li>replaced the home folder launcher with a "Places" plugin</li>
					<li>added various other launchers and two launcher menus (note the launchers with
					an arrow to their right side)</li>
					<li>workspace switcher shows 4 workspaces in a 2-row format</li>
					<li>on far right, a cpugraph plugin and an action button was added</li>
				</ul>		
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-06.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				If you are adding, deleting, or changing the positions of several items at once,
				it is probably easiest to do so from the <strong>Items</strong> tab under the
				<strong>Panel Preferences</strong> window as described above.  You can add
				several things at once from the <strong>Add New Items</strong> window, then
				position and edit them from the main <strong>Items</strong> list.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you just want to add one item to the panel, you could also just right-click
				an empty area on the panel and choose <strong>Panel -> Add New Items</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-07.png" /></p>
			<p>
				That will bring up the <strong>Add New Items</strong> window where you can choose
				an existing plugin to add, or create a new launcher for an application on the
				panel.  As an example, we will add a new launcher to the panel by highlighting it
				and clicking the <strong>Add</strong> button.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-08.png" /></p>
			<p>
				You will see a new launcher without an assigned icon show up on the far right
				side of the panel.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-09.png" /></p>
			<p>Right-click on it and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-10.png" /></p>
			<p>Click the <strong>+</strong> button to bring up a list of programs to select from.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-11.png" /></p>
			<p>Find and highlight the one you want, then click the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-12.png" /></p>
			<p>
				The launcher will now display the icon for the program you selected, but
				it will still be on the far right of the panel.  To move it somewhere else,
				just right-click it and select <strong>Move</strong>; then just
				drag it into position with your mouse.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-13.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				<strong>Creating a launcher menu,</strong> (giving you a choice to start more
				than one program from a single launcher), is done in the same manner as just
				described.  The only difference is that you add more than one item to the same
				launcher.  One might prefer to make a launcher menu instead of separate launchers
				to save space on the panel and/or to group similar types of programs.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our example, the Firefox web browser has a small arrow to the right of its
				icon.  We have installed two other browsers to the system and added them to
				the same launcher as Firefox on the panel.  Here is what the <strong>Launcher
				</strong> window looks like after adding the three browsers.  (Note that the
				one on the top of the list becomes the default choice and is the one whose
				icon is shown on the panel.)
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-14.png" /></p>
			<p>
				On the panel, if you click the Firefox icon it launches Firefox.  If you click
				the arrow to the right, it shows the other two and you can click either one to
				launch it.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-15.png" /></p>
			<p>
				If you need a more detailed description of the procedure to create a launcher
				menu, please see <a href="https://www.linuxliteos.com/forums/index.php?topic=1294.0" 
				target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on our forum.  The tutorial also describes
				some advanced tips like changing the position of the arrow on the launcher.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				<strong>Creating additional panels</strong> is easy to do.  From the <strong>
				Panel Preferences</strong> window, click the <strong>+</strong> sign along the
				top next to the <strong>Panel 1</strong> box.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/panel-16.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Now you will have a new (empty) panel showing on the desktop and the <strong>
				Panel Preferences</strong> window will show <strong>Panel 2</strong> along
				the top.  With <strong>Panel 2</strong> showing, you can now go about setting
				your preferences for the new panel under the <strong>Display, Appearance</strong>
				and <strong>Items</strong> tabs.  It is unlocked from the start so you can
				drag and place it where you like on the screen.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/panel-17.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				There are many more panel plugins available for installation than those
				pre-installed with Linux Lite. Have a look on
				<a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/start" 
				target="_blank">this XFCE site</a> for a comprehensive list of panel plugins that
				are available in the repositories.  They are listed with their real package names,
				so you can easily use the search function in the <strong>Synaptic Package
				Manager</strong> (found at <strong>Menu -> System -> Install/Remove Software
				</strong>) to find and install any that interest you.

			<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="tweaks">Window Manager Tweaks settings</a></font></strong></p>
			<p>
				Select <strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong> in the main <strong>Settings
				Manager</strong> window.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/tweaks-01.png" /></p>
			<p>
				<strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong> are an assortment of other
				settings you can change that effect window behavior.  They are organized
				under the tabs: Cycling, Focus, Accessibility, Workspaces, Placement and
				Compositor.  We will just touch on a few of these settings here.  The rest
				you can browse through at your leisure.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>Compositor</strong> tab is of particular importance.  It is here
				that you need to enable compositing if you plan to add transparency or opacity
				effects to your windows and/or panel(s).
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/tweaks-02.png" /></p>
			<p>
				Check the box to <strong>Enable display compositing</strong>.  Now you can
				access various transparency settings for windows as well as enable some
				shadow effects.  Here is an example showing the opacity of inactive windows
				changed.  Notice that the window in the background is now slightly faded.
			</p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/tweaks-03.png" /></p>
			<p>
				With compositing enabled, you may now make transparency and opacity
				changes to your panel(s).  Go to the <strong>Appearance</strong> tab
				under the <strong>Panel</strong> settings to make those changes.  Here
				is an example showing the panel with full transparency, so icons appear
				to float on the desktop.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/tweaks-04.png" /></p>
			<p><img border="1" src="img/customize/tweaks-05.png" /></p><br />
			<p>
				Back on <strong>Window Manager Tweaks</strong>, click on the <strong>
				Workspaces</strong> tab.  Here you have a few more settings that control
				interacting with your workspaces.
			</p>
			<p><img border="0" src="img/customize/tweaks-06.png" /></p>
			<p>
				The options are pretty self explanatory.  The last two options allow
				you to use your mouse to drag a window off one of the screen edges on
				to another workspace.
