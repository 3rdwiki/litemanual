			your system.</strong></p>
				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="software"></a>Installing &amp; 
				Removing Software</font></b></p>
				<p>Installing and removing software in Linux is much easier than in Windows.  The 
				vast majority of programs that you may want/need to install are all centrally
				located in what are called software repositories (repos).  Rather than searching the 
				web, downloading programs from various sites (some of which may not be reliable), 
				running the installer, rebooting, etc., available software is all centrally 
				located and available for installation in seconds.  The packages/(programs) in the 
				repositories are tested, approved for inclusion in the repos and securely signed
				to insure their validity.</p>
				<p>There are a few common methods for installing and removing 
				software.  Linux 
				Lite comes with the Synaptic Package Manager.  When you already know the name of
				the program you want, Synaptic makes installing easy.</p>  
				
				<p><b>IMPORTANT: Before you run Install/Remove 
				Software for the first time, <a href="#sources">read this first</a>.<br>
				Then come back to here to learn how to install and remove software.</b></p>
				<p>To install software use the following steps:</p>
				<p>1. Click on <b>Menu</b>, <b>System</b>, <b>Install/Remove 
				Software</b></p>
				<p>
				<img src="img/software/menu_synaptic.png" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>2. Make sure <b>All</b> is selected in the left pane and in the <b>Quick Filter</b> 
				or spy glass
				<img border="0" src="img/software/spyglass.png"> type in your search query. In 
				this example we will search for the &#39;<b>audacious</b>&#39; music 
				player.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/software/synaptic_search.png"></p>
				<p>3. Double click on the package you want to install.</p>
				<p>4. Some software will ask you to <b>Mark additional required 
				changes?</b> These are also known as dependencies and are 
				required for the program to function properly.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/synaptic_deps.png"></p>
				<p>5. Click on <b>Mark</b>. Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on 
				the Synaptic toolbar. The software will install and a <b>Menu</b> 
				entry will be created in the relevant <b>Menu</b> category. For 
				<b>audacious</b> 
				the <b>Menu</b> category would be <b>Multimedia</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="1" src="img/software/synaptic_apply.png"></p>
				<p>6. Go to the <b>Menu</b> and your new software will be there. 
				An alternative way to find your new software is to click on <b>
				Menu</b>, <b>Accessories</b>, <b>Application Finder</b>. Type 
				your program name in the <b>Search</b> box and the result will 
				display on the right. Double click on the program name and it 
				will launch for you.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/app_finder.png"></p>
				<p><b>Uninstalling Software:</b></p>
				<p>7.<b> </b>Uninstalling software is the reverse process of 
				installing software in the <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>. Type 
				the name of the software into the <b>Quick Filter</b> or spy 
				glass
				<img border="0" src="img/software/spyglass.png"> box.</p>
				<p>8. Right click on the software and select <b>Mark for Removal</b>. 
				Now hit the <b>Apply</b> button on the Synaptic toolbar and your 
				software will uninstall. Be very careful with this process as 
				you can inadvertently uninstall crucial system software. If you 
				have any doubts, please search the net first to see if it is 
				safe to uninstall the software. Synaptic is pretty good at 
				warning you should there be any potential problems.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b><a name="updates"><font size="4">Updates</font></a></b></p>
				<p>Keeping Linux Lite up to date is a simple process.</p>
				<p>At the top of your <b>Menu</b>, you will see <b>Install 
				Updates</b>.</p>
				<p>
				<img border="0" src="img/software/menu_updates.jpg"></p>
				<p>We&#39;ve made the update process as simple as possible. Simply 
				click on <b>Install Updates</b> and you will be asked for your 
				password. The program will then search for updates and if it 
				finds any it will ask you if you want to continue. Type <b>Y</b> 
				and then hit enter if you do.</p>
				<p>(<b>Note:</b> The update process updates all software on the system that 
				came from the repos.  Unlike in Windows, there is no need to 
				update individual software programs manually.  When you run <b>Install Updates</b>, that will update
				all packages that have updates available for them.)</p>
				<p><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><hr>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><b><a/><font size="4"></font><font size="4"><a name="heldpack">
				<a/>Packages that have been kept back</font></b></p>
				<a/>
				<p>Sometimes when performing <strong>Install Updates</strong>, 
				you will notice that there are held packages. Why does this 
				occur?</p>
			<p><img src="img/software/heldpack/held_pack1.png" /></p>
			<p>The reason those package are kept back is because they either 
			depend on extra packages not already installed or they are waiting 
			on compatible software from other sources. In other words, those 
			programs are waiting on other software to become available. When the 
			other software becomes available, the held packages will come out of 
			hold and be included in your regular updates. This occurs because 
			software is created by different people and comes from different 
			sources, those different projects must be compatible in order for 
			the software to function properly.</p>
			<p>If these held packages are installed prematurely, it could cause 
			that program to become unstable or even worse, unusable. You may 
			also inadvertently destabilize your system. <strong>The safest 
			course of action is to wait until the other packages are ready.</strong> 
			Then <strong>Install Updates</strong> will take care of all that for 
			you and merge the software together.</p>
			<p>There are some exceptions to this however. In the above example, 
			we can see there are held packages for LibreOffice. In the current 
			version of LibreOffice there is a bug which prevents users from 
			being able to save files. Here is where the exception takes 
			priority. Information gathered from the community states that an 
			upgrade of LibreOffice fixes this bug. So we need these held 
			packages.</p>
			<p>Close <strong>Install Updates</strong> if you have it open. Now 
			go to <strong>Menu, System, Install/Remove Software</strong>. Click 
			on <strong>Installed (upgradable)</strong> in the left pane, then 
			select all the packages that you want to upgrade, in this example 
			all the <strong>libreoffice</strong> packages. Now click on <strong>
			Apply</strong> and let the upgrade run its course.</p>
			<p><img src="img/software/heldpack/held_pack2.png" /></p>
			<p>In this particular example, installing the held <strong>
			LibreOffice</strong> packages fixes a known bug. This was first 
			tested on a working system, then the public was notified that it was 
			safe to do.</p>
			<p><strong>GOLDEN RULE: If your system if working fine, do not be 
			tempted to force installation of held packages, if it's working you 
			don't need it. This includes held kernel updates. Remember the old 
			saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".</strong></p>

				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="cleaner"></a>Lite Cleaner</font></b></p>
				<p><strong>Lite Cleaner</strong> is a tool that can be used periodically
				to clean up your system and free up more space on your hard drive.  It
				will do things like clean out various cached files, remove old
				dependency packages that are no longer needed, empty your trash and
				remove old kernels if you have installed new ones.</p>
				
				<p>Lite Cleaner is in <strong>Menu -> System -> Lite
				Cleaner</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-02.png" /></p>
				<p>Once opened, the Lite Cleaner window will show various categories of
				files that can be cleaned and will display in the "Description" column
				how much space will be freed up by removing them.  As an example, we'll
				use the cleaner to remove an old linux kernel.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-03.png" /></p>
				<p>The example computer has three kernels installed to it - the
				original kernel and two kernels manually added to it later.  If you have
				decided to install newer kernels to your Linux Lite, it is not a bad
				idea to keep two working kernels on the system.  If you end up having
				problems with one, you will then have the ability to boot into the
				system with the other one from the grub menu.</p>
				<p>The kernel cleaner will only display the kernels that are not
				currently in use.  So in screenshot below only two of the three kernels
				are displayed.  We will remove one of them.  To remove a kernel, make
				sure to select the "image" and "header" files that correspond to the
				version number of the kernel, then click <strong>Begin</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-04.png" /></p>
				<p>In the screenshot above you will notice that the original 3.13.0-24
				kernel and a newer 3.13.0-27 kernel are shown.  The newer kernel did not
				work correctly on this machine, so that is the one selected for
				removal.  Place a check mark in the boxes next to the "image" and "header"
				files, then click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
				<p>A confirmation box will pop-up.  Click <strong>Yes</strong> if you
				are sure you want to proceed with the deletion.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-05.png" /></p>
				<p>Enter your password and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-06.png" /></p>
				<p>Your kernel(s) will then be removed.  (This may take a few minutes.)</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/cleaner/cleaner-07.png" /></p>

				<p><a name="ppa"></a><b><font size="4">Adding a PPA</font></b></p>
				<p>A PPA is a repository containing one or more applications. 
				These are often set up for new software programs or updated 
				versions of some applications. To add a new PPA to your system, 
				follow the guide below.</p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu, System, Install/Remove Programs</b>. Enter 
				your password when asked.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/menu_synaptic.png"></p>
				<p>Go to <b>Settings, Repositories</b>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/ppa2.jpg" class="auto-style1"></p>
				<p>Click on the <b>Other Software</b> tab and click on the <b>Add
				</b>(bottom left) button and paste into the box the address of 
				the PPA.<br>
				In this example, we are going to add <b>Spotify</b> to our 
				system. Now click on <b>Add Source</b>. To finish, click on <b>
				Close</b>.<br>
				Close <b>Synaptic Package Manager</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa3.png"></p>
				<p>Each PPA comes with a signed key. This is a security measure 
				and ensures that the person who created the PPA has followed 
				strict standards. Open up a terminal and type in the key string:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table1" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 
						--recv-keys 94558F59</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa4.png"></p>
				<p>Now in the same terminal type in:</p>
				<table border="0" width="800" id="table2" bgcolor="#FFFF55">
					<tr>
						<td><b>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; 
				sudo apt-get install spotify-client</b></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/ppa5.png"></p>
				<p>This will update your sources to include the new Spotify 
				repository. The second part of the command will install Spotify 
				for you. Your new program is now installed and ready to use.</p>

				<p><b><font size="4"><a name="encrypt"></a>File Encryption</font></b></p>
				<p>In todays world, security of your personal files is 
				important. Whether your transporting documents on a USB drive or 
				emailing sensitive information to a friend, colleague or company, 
				encryption is a necessary security measure.</p>

				<p>1. First we need to install the encryption software, in this 
				example we'll use
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mcrypt" target="_blank">
				mcrypt</a>. Encryption algorithms include DES, Blowfish, 
				ARCFOUR, Enigma, GOST, LOKI97, RC2, Serpent, Threeway, Twofish, 
				WAKE, and XTEA.</p>
				<p>Open a terminal and type:</p>
				<p><strong>sudo apt-get install mcrypt -y</strong></p>
				<p>2. Once mcrypt is installed, we'll set a custom right click 
				action in our file manager to make encryption of files super 
				easy. Open up your home folder, click on <strong>Edit, Configure 
				custom actions</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt1.jpg" /></p>
				<p>3. Click the plus + button on the right and enter in the 
				following information, in the <strong>Command</strong> box type 
				in:</p>
				<p><strong>x-terminal-emulator -t "Encrypt file..." -e "mcrypt 
				%f"</strong></p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt2.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Click on <strong>Appearance Conditions</strong> tab and tick 
				every box except <strong>Directories</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt2a.png" /></p>
				<p>4. Go back to the <strong>Basic</strong> tab and click on the
				<strong>No icon</strong> button and browse to <strong>Status 
				Icons</strong>, and select the <strong>changes-prevent</strong> 
				icon and click on <strong>Ok</strong>, then <strong>Ok</strong> 
				on the next box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt3.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Your <strong>Custom Actions</strong> box should now look like 
				this:</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt4.jpg" /></p>
				<p>5. Now we need to set up the <strong>Decrypt</strong> option. 
				Repeat step 3 only this time enter in the following information, 
				in the <strong>Command</strong> box type in:</p>
				<p><strong>x-terminal-emulator -t "Decrypt file..." -e "mcrypt 
				-d %f"</strong></p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt5.jpg" /></p>
				<p>Click on <strong>Appearance Conditions</strong> tab and
				<strong>only</strong> tick the <strong>Other Files</strong> box, 
				leave the rest unticked.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt5a.png" /></p>
				<p>6. Repeat step 4 only this time select the <strong>
				changes-allow</strong> icon. The click on <strong>Ok</strong>, 
				then <strong>Ok</strong> on the next box.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt6.jpg" /></p>
				<p>7. Your <strong>Custom Actions</strong> box should now look 
				like this:</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt7.jpg" /></p>
				<p>8. Click on the <strong>Close</strong> button on the <strong>
				Custom Actions</strong> box.</p>
				<p>Now we're ready to encrypt a file (only files can be 
				encrypted with this method, not folders)</p>
				<p>9. Right click on a file and select <strong>Encrypt file</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt8.jpg" /></p>
				<p>10. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password, it 
				will then ask you to enter the same password again. Choose a 
				good strong password, a mixture of letters, numbers and 
				characters that you can easily remember.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt9.png" /></p>
				<p>You can now delete the unencrypted file permanently.<br />
				Here you will see we have a new file with the letters '<strong>.nc</strong>' 
				attached to the end of it signifying that the file is now 
				encrypted.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt10.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>11. To decrypt the file later, right click on the file and 
				select <strong>Decrypt file</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt11.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>12. A window will pop up asking you to type in a password. 
				Enter the password you created in step 10.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt12.png" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As you can see our file is decrypted and ready to view.</p>
				<p><img src="img/software/encrypt/encrypt13.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>If you make any changes to the decrypted file, you need to 
				delete the existing encrypted file and re-encypt the changed 
				file.</p>

				Extracting Zip files</a></font></b></p>
				<p>Sometimes we may have a collection of pictures to send 
				someone over email. Good practice is to zip these files up so 
				that the overall size is much less. The following is an example 
				of how to zip files and folders.</p>
				<p>Linux Lite supports creation and extraction of these archive
				file types using the <b>File Roller</b> program: <b>.zip .rar .tar
				.tar.gz .tar.bz2 .7z</b></p>
				<p>Archive files can be created/extracted through the right-click menu in the
				file manager, or by going to <b>Menu -> Accessories -> Archive
				Manager</b> and selecting files to archive or extract from there.</p>
				<p><b>Creating a zip file</b></p>
				<p>From within the file manager, right-click on any file or folder 
				and select <b>Create Archive</b>.  The following example will use a
				file named "file.txt".</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-01.jpg"></p>
				<p>A new window will pop up. From here, type in the <b>Filename</b>,
				eg. "file".</br>
				Use the drop-down box next to the filename to select the <b>zip</b>
				extension as the archive type.</br>
				Choose a location to save the file in, then click on the
				<b>Create</b> button.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-02.png"></p>
				<p>We now have a file called <b>file.zip</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-03.png"></p>
				<p><b>Zipping up multiple files</b></p>
				<p>Best practice here is to place all the files you want to zip 
				up into a folder. In this example we have a folder called <b>
				holiday</b> and inside 4 files.</p>
				<p><img border="1" src="img/software/archive/archive-04.jpg"></p>
				<p>Go back to your home folder and right click on the folder 
				containing the files you wish to zip up.<br>
				Right click the folder and select <b>Create Archive</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-05.jpg"></p>
				<p>A new window will pop up. From here, type in the <b>Filename</b> 
				of the file (eg. <b>holiday</b>>) and select <b>zip</b> for the
				archive type extension.  Choose a location for the file, then
				click the <b>Create</b> button.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-06.png"></p>
				<p>We now have a zip file called <b>holiday.zip</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-07.png"></p>
				<p><b>Extracting Zip files</b></p>
				<p>Right click on the zip file and select <b>Extract Here</b></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-08.jpg"></p>
				<p>We how have a folder called <b>holiday</b>, with our 4 files inside 
				of it.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-09.png"></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-04.jpg"></p>
				</br>
				<p><b>Using Archive Manager (File Roller) from the Menu to create
				a zip file.</b></p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu -> Accessories -> Archive Manager</b> to open the
				File Roller program.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-10.png"></p>
				<p>The program will open up to a blank window like below.  To
				create a zip file, click the "Create New Archive" button.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-11.png"></p>
				<p>In this example, we'll make a file named "Testing", choose
				the ".zip" extension type, use the "Location" box to point to
				where we want to save the files we are zipping, then click "Create".</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-12.png"></p>
				<p>A window will pop-up where you can <b>add</b> files to your
				zip archive.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-13.png"></p>
				<p>Click <b>Add Files</b>, then in the following window navigate
				to the files you want to archive and place a	check mark in the
				box(es) next to those you want to include.  Once all items are
				checked off, click <b>Add</b>.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-14.png"></p>
				<p>You will then see the files that were added in the Archive
				Manager window and the zip file will show up where you instructed
				it to be created.  You may close the Archive Manager at this point
				if you are done.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-15.png"></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-16.png"></p></br>
				<p><b>Using Archive Manager (File Roller) from the Menu to unzip
				a zip file.</b></p>
				<p>Go to <b>Menu -> Accessories -> Archive Manager</b>, click
				<b>Open</b> and navigate to the archive file you want, then click
				<b>Open</b> again.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-17.png"></p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-18.png"></p>
				<p>The files will be displayed in the Archive Manager.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-19.png"></p>
				<p>Click <b>Extract</b> and direct them to the location you want them
				extracted to on the next window.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-20.png"></p>
				<p>A pop-up window will notify you that the extraction is done.</p>
				<p><img border="0" src="img/software/archive/archive-21.png"></p>
				<p>If you click <b>Show the Files</b>, it will open the file
				manager to display their location.</p>

				<b><a name="deskenv">Changing Desktop Environments</a></b></font></p>
				<p>
				This distro is a heavily modified version of the XFCE desktop 
				environment. However, being GNU/Linux based allows people the 
				freedom to modify their system as they see fit. There are 
				numerous desktop environments in GNU/Linux. Including but not 
				limited to:</p>
				<p>
				Enlightenment<br>
				Gnome<br>
				KDE<br>
				LXDE<br>
				Razor-qt</p>
				<p>
				If you desire to install another desktop environment, we cannot 
				provide specific instructions on how to do this. There are far 
				to many variables involved and much can go wrong. This kind of 
				system modification is best left to experienced Linux users. The 
				whole philosophy behind Linux Lite is to provide new users to 
				Linux based operating systems an easy to use, functional desktop 
				experience. Our support time is better spent dedicated to helping
				existing Linux Lite users on the XFCE desktop.</p>
